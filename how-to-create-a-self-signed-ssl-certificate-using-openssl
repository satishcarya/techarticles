Situation
You can use the Reporter OpenSSL utility to generate a Private Key, Certificate Siging Request (CSR) and Self-Signed Certificate.

In Windows with Reporter installed, the OpenSSL utility is located in "Program Files\Blue Coat Reporter 9\utilities\ssl"

Step 1: Generate a Private Key 
 
Use the openssl toolkit, which is available in Blue Coat Reporter 9\utilities\ssl, to generate an RSA Private Key and CSR (Certificate Signing Request).
It can also be used to generate self-signed certificates that can be used for testing purposes or internal usage (more details in Step 3).
The first step is to create your RSA Private Key. This key is a 1024-bit or 2048 RSA key with encrypted. Blue Coat does not recommend non-encrypted key.
The key length 1024 is not long enough; the recommended length is 2048. If it uses encrypted key, openssl asks for  pass phrase.

a) Double-click the openssl tool under Blue Coat Reporter 9\utilities\ssl and enter the following command:

openssl >genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024 
or
openssl >genrsa -des3 -out server.key 2048 


b) After pressing Enter, you are asked to enter a pass phrase for the server.key. You can enter any pass phrase.

Enter pass phrase for server.key:
 
c) The server.key generates in Blue Coat Reporter 9\utilities\ssl; this is required later in the procedure. 
 
Step 2: Generate a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) 
 
After the private key is generated, you can generate a Certificate Signing Request.
The CSR is sent to a Certificate Authority, such as Verisign, that verifies the identity of the requestor and issues a signed certificate.
The second option is to self-sign the CSR (Step 3 uses this for demonstration).
 
During the generation of the CSR, you are prompted for several pieces of information. These are the X.509 attributes of the certificate.
Blue Coat recommends SHA-2 for Certificates. The command to generate the CSR is as follows:

req –new –key private_key_file_name.key -sha256 –out csr_file_name.csr

a) Enter the following command at the prompt:

Openssl> req -new -key server.key -sha256  -out server.csr


b) This command prompts for the following X.509 attributes of the certificate.
Enter appropriate information based on the environment; for example:
 

Country Name (2 letter code) [GB]: For example: US or CA.
State or Province Name (full name) [Berkshire]: For example: California
Locality Name (eg, city) [Newbury]: For example: Berkeley
Organization Name (eg, company) [My Company Ltd]: For example: BlueCoat
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:For example: IT
Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:For example: bluecoat.com
Email Address []:For example: martin.John@bluecoat.com
Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []:
An optional company name []:

 
c) The server.csr generates in Blue Coat Reporter 9\utilities\ssl and you can use this CSR to submit to CA to issue a signed certificate.
 
Step 3: Generating a Self-Signed Certificate 
 
As mentioned above, you must send the CSR to Certificate Authority, such as Verisign, that verifies the identity of the requestor and issues a signed certificate.
Or you can use self-sign the CSR if you either do not plan to have your certificate signed by a CA or you want to just test it only while the CA is signing your certificate.
This example uses a self-signed certificate method by using the openssl tool to generate a temporary certificate that generates an error in the client browser to the effect that the signing certificate authority is unknown and not trusted.
 
a) To generate a temporary certificate, which is good for 365 days, issue the following command:

Openssl> x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -sha256 -out server.crt
Signature ok
subject=/C=US/ST=California/L=Berkeley/O=BlueCoat/OU=IT/CN=bluecoat.com/em
ailAddress=martin.john@bluecoat.com
Getting Private key
Enter pass phrase for server.key:

 
b) You must enter the pass phrase for the server.key that you entered in the step 1 above.
c) The server.crt generates in Blue Coat Reporter 9\utilities\ssl and you need to use this CRT to convert it to PEM format, which can be readable by Reporter.
 
Step 4: Convert the CRT to PEM format
 
Use the openssl tool to convert the CRT to a PEM format, which is readable by Reporter.
 
a) Enter the following command at the prompt:

Openssl> x509 -in server.crt -out server.pem -outform PEM

b) The server.pem generates in Blue Coat Reporter 9\utilities\ssl; you will use this in the next step.

Step 5: Configure Reporter to use the server.pem and private key

a) Log into the Reporter user interface and navigate to Administration > General Settings > System Settings > Server Settings.
b) Under Protocol, select the HTTPS option. Ensure the port number matches the port number that was configured for the SSL certificate.
c) Under Certificate, select the Enter Certificate option.
d) Locate and select the certificate file that was generated in the previous step: server.pem.
e) Locate and select the private key file: server.key.
f)  Test the certificate and key to ensure Reporter can read them.
g) Save the changes and restart the Reporter service.
