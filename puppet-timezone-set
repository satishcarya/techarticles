puppet-timezone Build Status
Manage timezone settings via Puppet

Supported Puppet versions
Puppet >= 4
Last version supporting Puppet 3: v3.5.0
Usage
Set timezone to UTC
class { 'timezone':
    timezone => 'UTC',
}
Set timezone to Europe/Berlin
class { 'timezone':
    timezone => 'Europe/Berlin',
}
Other class parameters
ensure: present or absent, default: present
autoupgrade: true or false, default: false. Auto-upgrade package, if there is a newer version
hwutc: true or false, default: undef. This parameter will ensure that the real time clock is set to UTC rather than the local timezone. This is not supported on all platforms and will fail if you try and set it on an unsupported platform. A typical error message from the timedatectl command, if this value is set to false would be:
Warning: The system is configured to read the RTC time in the local time zone.
         This mode can not be fully supported. It will create various problems
         with time zone changes and daylight saving time adjustments. The RTC
         time is never updated, it relies on external facilities to maintain it.
         If at all possible, use RTC in UTC by calling
         'timedatectl set-local-rtc 0'.
