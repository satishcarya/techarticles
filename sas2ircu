Linux and Hardware RAID: an administrator's summary
Summary of all known drivers
Details about individual drivers
Related pages
For RAID to be useful in an enterprise environment, one needs to get a warning when a disk fails, and be able to replace this disk without having to reboot. This page is a summary of the status of some (most/all) hardware RAID drivers supported by the default Linux kernel.

The following criteria is being considered:

Driver name
Name of the Linux kernel module. If the name changes between kernel versions, remember to include information in the detailed information section.
Supported
Supported by Linux kernel? Is the kernel driver needed for this RAID system available in the default kernel?
Status
RAID status easily available? Is there a text file in /proc/ or similar reporting the status of the RAID systems? If not, is the source for some command line tool available which can report this status? (Minimum status information is OK or degraded (i.e. some disk is faulty/missing). If such information is easily available, monitoring tools can be written to detect and report failures.
Command Line Interface (CLI) tool
CLI tool for manipulating the RAID? Is the source for a command line interface tool available for adding and removing disks from the RAID set? This is a must when maintaining a lot of machines using for instance a serial line console. The source must be acceptable into debian/main.
Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool
GUI tool for manipulating the RAID? Some find it easier to use graphical tools. Same source requirements as the CLI tools.
Debian-Installer
Is the hardware supported by the Debian-Installer? If not, please report a bug with workaround if known.

Details about individual drivers
3w-xxxx
Hardware using this driver: 3ware 8xxx controllers and earlier.

There is a CLI tool (tw_cli) from 3Ware which supports all functions of the card.

There is a GUI tool (3dm2) accessible via browser used for management and monitoring daemon that configures the RAID, monitors the disk status and sends mail on failure.

Both tools are available as Debian packages from http://jonas.genannt.name/

aacraid
Hardware using this driver: Dell PowerEdge 2650, Adaptec SCSI RAIDs 2200S, 2120S, SATA RAID 2810SA, Perc 3/Di controllers.

Adaptec and Dell used to provide afacli tool for manipulating RAID sets, however it is no longer supporting the current AACRAID controllers. Also, afacli requires libraries that are no longer available in Debian distributions. At the end of aacraid section is the old information on tools available on Dell website, which may be useful for older distributions and controllers.

Current software for managing AAC arrays is available at Adaptec website: http://www.adaptec.com/en-us/downloads/storage_manager/sm/productid=aar-2820sa&dn=adaptec+serial+ata+ii+raid+2820sa.html, latest version is Adaptec Storage Manager v5.20.17414 for Linux (available also in 64bit version).

This RPM archive includes both arcconf binary, as well as Storage Manager - GUI tool, using SUN Java (binaries are included in RPM)

After installing the package, the following actions are required:

run grep aac /proc/devices, you will get a number in answer like 253 aac

create appropriate device using this number: mknod /dev/afa0 c 253 0

to get array status, usually one needs to launch: arcconf getconfig 1

Note: arcconf requires libstdc++.so.5 library, available in the libstdc++5 package.

Below is information on the old afacli tool

Dell also provides some admin tools in binary form. See http://linux.dell.com/storage.shtml#aacraid, under the Management Utility heading.

Latest version seems to be provided as afaapps-4.1-0.i386.rpm out of an archive available on support site as afa-apps-snmp.2807420-A04.tar.gz. The RPM can be converted to .deb package which will install fine.
however, the version of afacli in afaapps-4.1-0.i386.rpm seems not to be working for etch on my PE4400 (strace-ing doesn't help much, other report and workaround here also : http://lists.us.dell.com/pipermail/linux-poweredge/2007-July/032200.html)...

so had to revert to previous version provided in in afa-apps-snmp.2806076-A02.tar.gz which contains afaapps-2.8-0.i386.rpm...
at the end of 2007 Adaptec released new version of their arcconf utility which supports newer raid cards; moreover it's finally available for amd64 arch (no need in ia32-libs). This utility along with other crap can be downloaded here: i386, amd64 (newest version as of 18/jan/2008 is 5.20.17414)

NB: I had some problems with Adaptec 2810SA. Debian kernel freezes (rejected IO to offline devices) in case array becomes downgraded (ie one disk failed). I had to patch kernel with adaptec driver, and kernel stops freezing with one drive fail -- AlexanderVlasov

arcmsr
Hardware using this driver: all ARECA SATA controllers.

Areca is a fairly new player on the SATA Hardware RAID market, but they offer unprecedented features and have excellent driver support for Linux. Their hardware supports RAID-6 in addition to the other levels, and online expansion + migration as well. The driver is in the main kernel as of 2.6.19, but debian supports it since etch (2.6.18).

They have, amongst others, an 'archttp' module which enables a web interface(!) to the card which offers full functionality. Archttp is statically linked so it will run in virtually all circumstances. Since it offers both a wide range of monitoring and maintenance functions, archttp + a webbrowser is all you'll ever need, and it fulfills, IMHO, the functions of CLI, GUI and proc entry all in one. (Well, you really have to see it.)

Beware: archttp tries to use /dev/ttyS0, so if you use it in any other way you should take care about this issue.

CLI tool (statically linked i386 and amd64 binaries) also can be downloaded from ftp site. The 'sg' module must be loaded for it to work, the cli program segfaults without it. Vendor support page: http://www.areca.com.tw/support/main.htm

* The new ARC-18xx series is NOT supported by the old driver included in the Kernel, only the ARC11xx/12xx/13xx/16xx will work

** Most of their series have an out-of-band management with build in Webserver, no need for installing any software to manage controllers/arrays

cciss
Hardware using this driver: various servers from Compaq/HP, HP ProLiant DL380 G5, etc. (RAID controller HP P410*, etc.)

A daemon detecting status changes and reporting to syslog as SNMP traps is packaged as cpqarrayd. Some information is available in /proc/driver/cciss/cciss0. The array-info tool can extract the RAID status for cciss devices.

The cciss_vol_status tool (packaged as cciss-vol-status) will report RAID status for cciss devices. See bug #656630 for a proposal for a controller status monitoring tool based on cciss_vol_status output.

May be replaced by hpsa in recent kernels

hpsa
This is the 'next generation' driver which replaces cciss for many cards. Notably this driver uses the kernel scsi subsystem rather than implementing its own block device. As such disks presented by this driver will have the normal /dev/sdX naming rather than /dev/cciss/c0d0 used with the cciss driver.

Hardware using this driver: various servers from Compaq/HP, HP ProLiant DL380 G5, etc. (RAID controller HP P410*, etc.)

Utilities for the cciss driver also work with this driver, though they should be directed to use the /dev/sgX generic scsi devices rather than the cciss devices as all the HP specific IOCTL interfaces are identical.

See also HP/ProLiant#HP_Repository and http://hwraid.le-vert.net/wiki/SmartArray for links to the proprietary HP tools, including the hpacucli management CLI tool.

ips
Hardware using this driver: IBM Netfinity 5500, IBM Netfinity 5600, IBM eserver xSeries 226, IBM eserver xSeries 345, IBM eserver xSeries 346.

Information on BIOS version and RAID configuration is available from /proc/scsi/ips/0. This file does not contain the RAID status. Note: /proc/scsi/ips/0 seems to be not provided anymore. Tested with Linux 3.16 and 4.5.

There is a precompiled command line tool (ipssend) available from the vendor CD and IBM's dumplog archive. It can be used to get information on the RAID status, and also be used to configure and administrate the RAID. Note: The ipssend binary does crash when trying to access the non existing /proc/scsi/scsi directory. Tested ibm_utl_ipssend_7.12.14_linux_32-64.zip So this tool seems to be useless with current Linux versions.

There is also a graphical raid tool (RaidMan) available in RPM format from the vendor CD.
