The NetBackup services do not automatically start after installing NetBackup on Linux with systemd.
Problem
After a NetBackup 7.7.1, 7.7.2 or 7.7.3 install or upgrade on Linux Red Hat version 7 update 2 and SUSE 12 SP1 with systemd the pbx_exchange service fails to start upon reboot. 

Note: Please refer Software Compatibility List (SCL) for platform supportability.

Error Message
There are no error messages for pbx (private branch exchange) daemon upon reboot because the daemon/service is not started. However, an Administrator could see an error while opening the Administrative Console or while executing a command. 

Example: While opening remote NetBackup Administration Console: 
Unable to login, status: 526 

Example: While executing the command: 
# nbemmcmd -listhosts 
Failed to initialize EMM connection.  Verify that network access to the EMM server is available and that the services nbemm and pbx_exchange are running on the EMM server. (195) 
 
Cause

Previous versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, which were distributed with SysV init or Upstart, used init scripts located in the /etc/rc.d/init.d/ directory. These init scripts were typically written in Bash, and allowed the system administrator to control the state of services and daemons in their system. These init scripts have been replaced with service units. Service units end with the .service file extension and serve a similar purpose as init scripts. 

The NetBackup install script does not create the service unit for systemd but NetBackup is supported on Red Hat Linux 7 update 2 and SUSE 12 SP1 because systemd will run traditional init scripts. Additionally the Linux systemd will attempt to convert traditional init scripts to systemd services files by way of the systemd-sysv-generator tool.

While this conversion process is successful for netbackup it will fail for for vxpbx_exchanged. 
The NetBackup install creates two startup scripts, there's one for netbackup and the second for vxpbx. 
Example:​
/etc/init.d/netbackup
/etc/init.d/vxpbx_exchanged -> /opt/VRTSpbx/bin/vxpbx_exchanged

Note that /etc/init.d/vxpbx_exchanged is a link /opt/VRTSpbx/bin/vxpbx_exchanged.

The systemd-sysv-generator tool attempts to convert traditional init scripts and places them in /var/run/systemd/generator.late folder at boot. NetBackup will be fully operational after the installation but only until the first reboot as that's when the conversion process take place. After reboot the conversion is successful for netbackup but not for vxpbx_exchanged because vxpbx_exchanged is a link to / opt/VRTSpbx/bin/vxpbx_exchanged. With no vxpbx_exchanged.service file, pbx_exchange service does not start and because it's a prerequisite for netbackup, the  netbackup.service fails to start those NetBackup services dependent upon pbx_exchange .

This is an example list of /etc/init.d  after the initial install: 
# ls -l

This is an example list of  /var/run/systemd/generator.late  after the reboot. 
# ls -l

-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 572 Jan 22 12:52 vmware-tools.service 

In the example above note that all of the init scripts in /etc/init.d are converted to .service files in  /var/run/systemd/generator.late  with the exception of   vxpbx_exchanged.

You are looking for the traditional init scripts in /etc/rc.d/init.d, and they are gone? 
Here's an explanation on what's going on: You are running a systemd-based OS where traditional init scripts have been replaced by native systemd services files. Service files provide very similar functionality to init scripts. To make use of service files simply invoke "systemctl", which will output a list of all currently running services (and other units). Use "systemctl list-unit-files" to get a listing of all known unit files, including stopped, disabled and masked ones. Use "systemctl start foobar.service" and "systemctl stop foobar.service" to start or stop a service, respectively. For further details, please refer to systemctl(1). 

Note that traditional init scripts continue to function on a systemd system. An init script /etc/rc.d/init.d/foobar is implicitly mapped into a service unit foobar.service during system initialization.

Reference: Ubuntu 15.04 Server With Systemd - Richard Peterson.
System V Scripts and generated systemd service files:
/etc/init.d and /run/systemd/generator.late 

Some services are not yet configured natively for use by systemd. They are installed without a systemd service file. Instead a SysV script is installed in the /etc/init.d directory. The systemd-sysv-generator tool automatically reads this script and generates a corresponding systemd unit file in the /var/run/systemd/generator.late directory, which, in turn, will use the script to manage the service.

Workaround
Add  vxpbx_exchanged to systemd control.
​A fter installing NetBackup remove the link for vxpbx_exchanged and copy the startup file directly to /etc/init.d.
# cd /etc/init.d
# rm vxpbx_exchanged
# cp  /opt/VRTSpbx/bin/vxpbx_exchanged ./vxpbx_exchanged
 
This is the updated folder list of  /etc/init.d

Reboot the system:
​ # systemctl reboot
Check that vxpbx and NetBackup services have started (see example outputs below)
# systemctl status vxpbx_exchanged

​ Alternate way to check that vxpbx and netbackup services have started.
​ # systemctl list-units --type service | egrep -i "netbackup|vxpbx"

NetBackup is now under systemd control.
To control NetBackup use systemd commands.
To stop NetBackup and vxpbx:
systemctl stop netbackup.service
systemctl stop vxpbx_exchanged.service
To start NetBackup and vxpbx:
systemctl start vxpbx_exchanged.service
systemctl start netbackup.service
 Additional information:
All NetBackup commands remain fully functional.
During an upgrade the vxpbx_exchanged link and or file could be updated. When the file and or link is updated, repeat the work around and update the vxpbx_exchanged file to the latest version.
