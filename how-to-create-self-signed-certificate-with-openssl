How to create a self-signed certificate with openssl?
openssl req -new > cert.csr
openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out key.pem
openssl x509 -in cert.csr -out cert.pem -req -signkey key.pem -days 1001
cat key.pem>>cert.pem

Self-signed certificates are considered insecure for the Internet. Firefox will treat the site as having an invalid certificate, while Chrome will act as if the connection was plain HTTP. More details: gerv.net/security/self-

You need to import your CA certificate into your browsers and tell the browsers you trust the certificate -or- get it signed by one of the big money-for-nothing organizations that are already trusted by the browsers -or- ignore the warning and click past it. I like the last option myself. â€“

You should not use the "stock" OpenSSL settings like that. That's because you cannot place DNS names in the Subject Alternate Name (SAN). You need to provide a configuration file with an alternate_names section and pass it with the -config option. Also, placing a DNS name in the Common Name (CN) is deprecated (but not prohibited) by both the IETF and the CA/Browser Forums. Any DNS name in the CN must also be present in the SAN. There's no way to avoid using the SAN. See answer below.

with single command 

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
