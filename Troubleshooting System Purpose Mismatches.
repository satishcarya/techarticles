Issue
With the introduction of setting system purpose attributes, a new System Purpose Status value is reported by subscription-manager status.

Why Mismatched is reported by the subscription-manager status command?

Resolution
To resolve the status of Mismatched, there are a few paths to take:

In the case of not having any subscription attached, attach a subscription that matches the System Purpose attributes that have been configured on the system. Running auto-attach will attempt to resolve this issue on its own.
In the case of having subscriptions attached that do not match the System Purpose attributes that have been configured, reconfigure the System Purpose attributes for that system to match the subscription OR change the subscription that is attached to the system.
Note: An example of what this looks like is located within the Root Cause section of this article.

An alternative solution to these is to unset System Purpose attributes from the system. While these attributes are unset on a given system, they cannot be in a Mismatched state. It is the same as saying that you have no preference for the System Purpose or subscription types to attach.

You can use the syspurpose tool from the CLI to manipulate these items after installation:

Raw
[root@rhel8 ~]# syspurpose --help
usage: syspurpose [-h]

                {set,unset,add,remove,set-role,unset-role,add-addons,remove-addons,unset-addons,set-sla,unset- 
sla,set-usage,unset-usage,show}
                ...

System Syspurpose Management Tool

positional arguments:
{set,unset,add,remove,set-role,unset-role,add-addons,remove-addons,unset-addons,set-sla,unset-sla,set- 
usage,unset-usage,show}
                      sub-command help
  set                 Sets the value for the given property
  unset               Unsets (clears) the value for the given property
  add                 Adds the value(s) to the given property
  remove              Removes the value(s) from the given property
  set-role            Set the system role to the system syspurpose
  unset-role          Clear set role
  add-addons          Add addons to the system syspurpose
  remove-addons       Remove addons from the system syspurpose
  unset-addons        Clear set addons
  set-sla             Set the system sla
  unset-sla           Clear set sla
  set-usage           Set the system usage
  unset-usage         Clear set usage
  show                Show the current system syspurpose

optional arguments:
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
Some subscriptions SKU without the Service Level attributes will not behave as expected. The system purpose attributes are Role, Usage, service_level_agreement, and Add-ons. To see the System Purpose attributes associated with a subscription, check for the Roles, Service Level,Usage, and Add-ons when reviewing subscription information via subscription-manager list --available --all command.

Subscriptions who's service level is other than Premium, Standard or self-support might give issues when assigning system purpose attributes. Some examples are Dev professional, etc because the Service Level for these subscriptions is different.

If you are unable to get into a Matched state, please contact Red Hat Technical Support by opening a case.

Root Cause
When Mismatched is reported by the subscription-manager status command, it means that the user has set a system purpose attribute value that is not currently being satisfied.

There are two scenarios where System Purpose may become 'Mismatched':

The system has System Purpose attributes set, but there are no subscriptions attached to meet those requirements.
The system has System Purpose attributes set, and has one or more subscriptions with attributes that do not match those requirements.
Looking at the syspurpose output from an example system:

Raw
[root@rhel8 ~]# syspurpose show
{
"role": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server",
"service_level_agreement": "Premium",
"usage": "Production"
}
The information from the subscription that corresponds with this is as follows:

Raw
[root@rhel8 ~]# subscription-manager list --consumed
Subscription Name:   Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server, Premium (Physical or Virtual Nodes)
Provides:            dotNET on RHEL Beta (for RHEL Server)
<SNIP>-----------------
Roles:               Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server      <-- Role (Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server / 
Workstation / Compute Node)
Service Level:       Premium                        <-- SLA / Service Level Agreement (Self-Support, 
Standard, Premium, etc..)
Usage:               Production                  <-- Usage (Disaster Recovery, Development/Test, 
Production)
Add-ons:                                <-- Addons such as High Availability, Extended Update Support 
(Not in use yet)

Diagnostic Steps
To see your current System Purpose configuration from the CLI, run:

Raw
[root@rhel8 ~]# subscription-manager status
+-------------------------------------------+
   System Status Details
+-------------------------------------------+
Overall Status: Current

System Purpose Status: Mismatched
- The requested usage preference "Production" is not provided by a currently consumed subscription.
- The service level preference "Premium" is not provided by a currently consumed subscription.
- The requested role "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server" is not provided by a currently consumed subscription.
Raw
[root@rhel8 ~]# syspurpose show
{
  "role": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server",
  "service_level_agreement": "Premium",
  "usage": "Production"
}
