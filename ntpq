22.13. CHECKING THE STATUS OF NTP
To check if ntpd is configured to run at system start, issue the following command:
~]$ chkconfig --list ntpd
ntpd           	0:off	1:off	2:on	3:on	4:on	5:on	6:off
By default, when ntpd is installed, it is configured to start at every system start.
To check if ntpd is running, issue the following command:
~]$ ntpq -p
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter

The command lists connected time servers and displays information indicating when they were last polled and the stability of the replies. The column headings are as follows:
remote and refid: remote NTP server, and its NTP server
st: stratum of server
t: type of server (local, unicast, multicast, or broadcast)
poll: how frequently to query server (in seconds)
when: how long since last poll (in seconds)
reach: octal bitmask of success or failure of last 8 queries (left-shifted); 377 = 11111111 = all recent queries were successful; 257 = 10101111 = 4 most recent were successful, 5 and 7 failed
delay: network round trip time (in milliseconds)
offset: difference between local clock and remote clock (in milliseconds)
jitter: difference of successive time values from server (high jitter could be due to an unstable clock or, more likely, poor network performance)
To obtain a brief status report from ntpd, issue the following command:
~]$ ntpstat
unsynchronised
  time server re-starting
   polling server every 64 s
~]$ ntpstat
synchronised to NTP server (10.5.26.10) at stratum 2
   time correct to within 52 ms
   polling server every 1024 s
