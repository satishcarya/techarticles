Please remember you must be root user when installing packages in Linux, with the root privileges you can manage rpm commands with their appropriate options.

1. How to Check an RPM Signature Package
Always check the PGP signature of packages before installing them on your Linux systems and make sure its integrity and origin is OK. Use the following command with –checksig (check signature) option to check the signature of a package called pidgin.

[root@tecmint]# rpm --checksig pidgin-2.7.9-5.el6.2.i686.rpm
pidgin-2.7.9-5.el6.2.i686.rpm: rsa sha1 (md5) pgp md5 OK
2. How to Install an RPM Package
For installing an rpm software package, use the following command with -i option. For example, to install an rpm package called pidgin-2.7.9-5.el6.2.i686.rpm.

[root@tecmint]# rpm -ivh pidgin-2.7.9-5.el6.2.i686.rpm
Preparing...                ########################################### [100%]
1:pidgin                 ########################################### [100%]
RPM command and options
-i : install a package
-v : verbose for a nicer display
-h: print hash marks as the package archive is unpacked.
3. How to check dependencies of RPM Package before Installing
Let’s say you would like to do a dependency check before installing or upgrading a package. For example, use the following command to check the dependencies of BitTorrent-5.2.2-1-Python2.4.noarch.rpm package. It will display the list of dependencies of package.

[root@tecmint]# rpm -qpR BitTorrent-5.2.2-1-Python2.4.noarch.rpm
/usr/bin/python2.4
python >= 2.3
python(abi) = 2.4
python-crypto >= 2.0
python-psyco
python-twisted >= 2.0
python-zopeinterface
rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) = 2.6
RPM command and options
-q : Query a package
-p : List capabilities this package provides.
-R: List capabilities on which this package depends..
4. How to Install a RPM Package Without Dependencies
If you know that all needed packages are already installed and RPM is just being stupid, you can ignore those dependencies by using the option –nodeps (no dependencies check) before installing the package.

[root@tecmint]# rpm -ivh --nodeps BitTorrent-5.2.2-1-Python2.4.noarch.rpm
Preparing...                ########################################### [100%]
1:BitTorrent             ########################################### [100%]
The above command forcefully install rpm package by ignoring dependencies errors, but if those dependency files are missing, then the program will not work at all, until you install them.

5. How to check an Installed RPM Package

[root@tecmint]# rpm -q BitTorrent
BitTorrent-5.2.2-1.noarch

/usr/bin/bittorrent-curses
/usr/bin/bittorrent-tracker
/usr/bin/changetracker-console
/usr/bin/launchmany-console
/usr/bin/launchmany-curses

9. How to Upgrade a RPM Package
If we want to upgrade any RPM package “–U” (upgrade) option will be used. One of the major advantages of using this option is that it will not only upgrade the latest version of any package, but it will also maintain the backup of the older package so that in case if the newer upgraded package does not run the previously installed package can be used again.

[root@tecmint]# rpm -Uvh nx-3.5.0-2.el6.centos.i686.rpm

[root@tecmint]# rpm -evv nx
11. How to Remove an RPM Package Without Dependencies
